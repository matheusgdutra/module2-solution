                    <p> Typical dish of the Brazilian Northeastern cuisine. For some, panelada is the ultimate comfort food. For others, even the smell of panelada cooking is enough to send them flying out of the kitchen. A proper panelada is prepared with the intestine, rumen and pieces of ox paws. It's these ingredients that make panelada, to coin a phrase, one man's meat and another man's poison.</p>
